Given a list of numbers, create an algorithm that arranges them in order to form the largest possible integer. 
For example, given [10, 7, 76, 415], you should return 77641510

Sort the numbers by biggest continuous number.
choose the number that first number has biggest magnitude. if tie go to next number.
if one has no number to compare (7 vs 76) see if there is a number that has bigger first number than 6. remember to include itself.
